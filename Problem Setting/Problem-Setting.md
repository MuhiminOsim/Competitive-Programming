## National Contest Problem Setting:
I started as a problem setter and judge of national contests since January, 2020. So far I have created the following problems:

#### National High School Programming Contest (NHSPC) Preliminary Round 2020 ([Contest Link](https://toph.co/c/nhspc2020-preliminary))
1. [Osim's Maze](https://toph.co/p/osim-s-maze)

## Online Contest & Other Onsite Contest Problem Setting:
I have been working on problem setting since 2019. Here are some problems of mine which have been published in different online and onsite contests so far.

#### Toph Winter Spar 2019 ([Contest Link](https://toph.co/c/tough-winter-spar-2019))
1. [Milad's Lost Tree](https://toph.co/p/milad-s-lost-tree)

#### Toph Criterion 2020 Round 4 ([Contest Link](https://toph.co/c/criterion-2020-round-4))
1. [Maximum Meetings](https://toph.co/p/maximum-meetings)

I have also created few problems unofficially for an interview preparation platform.

N.B. Please feel free to knock me if you find any issues regarding any of the problems.
